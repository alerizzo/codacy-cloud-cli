/**
 * Codacy accepts two kinds of token, on two different headers, with two very
 * different scopes:
 *
 *  - an **account token** (`api-token` header) reaches anything the account can
 *    see: every organization, every repository, every endpoint;
 *  - a **repository token** (`project-token` header, also called a project
 *    token) is issued for a single repository and is accepted only on a small,
 *    fixed whitelist of repository-scoped operations. Everywhere else the API
 *    rejects it exactly as if no token had been sent.
 *
 * That last point is why the CLI has to know which kind it holds *before* it
 * calls: a bare `Error: Unauthorized` tells the user nothing, so commands
 * refuse (or skip a section) up front instead. See `SPECS/repository-tokens.md`
 * for the whitelist and the per-command support matrix.
 *
 * The discriminated union makes "exactly one token, and we always know which
 * kind and where it came from" a compile-time property: there is no way to
 * build a value carrying both, or neither. `source` is carried so refusals can
 * name the thing the user actually set — the difference between an explicit
 * `--repository-token` and an ambient `CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN` is exactly what
 * makes a surprising refusal debuggable in one read.
